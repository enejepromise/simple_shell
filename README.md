This project is all about understanding how shells operate, including their interaction with users, execution of commands, and handling of processes.
Exploring the concepts of Process IDs (PIDs) and Parent Process IDs (PPIDs) in Unix process management.
Learning about environment manipulation in Unix processes, including techniques for modifying process environments.
Understanding the difference between functions and system calls, their purposes, and how they interact with the operating system.
Exploring process creation, suspension, and termination mechanisms in Unix systems.
Investigating the different prototypes of the main function in C programming.
Learning how shells use the PATH environment variable to locate executable programs.
Understanding the execution of programs within processes using system calls like execve.
Exploring methods to suspend process execution until specific conditions are met, such as the termination of child processes.
Gaining knowledge about EOF (End-of-File) and its significance in file and stream handling operations in Unix.
Overall, the project aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of Unix concepts, system-level programming, and the intricate workings of Unix-based environments.
